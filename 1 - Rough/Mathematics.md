1. For the following distribution, 

| Class interval | Frequency |
| -------------- | --------- |
| 0-10           | 20        |
| 10-20          | 30        |
| 20-30          | 24        |
| 30-40          | 40        |
| 40-50          | 18        |
The sum of lower limits of the modal class and medium class is: **50**

- Finding total frequencies (N): $\Sigma N$ = 132 
	- Finding median class: $\frac{132}{2} = 66$ 
- Finding cumulative frequencies: 
- 0–10: 20
- 10–20: 20 + 30 = 50
- 20–30: 50 + 24 = 74
- 30–40: 74 + 40 = 114
- 40–50: 114 + 18 = 132

**66** falls in the 20-30 class interval 

$\therefore$ 20-30 is the median class. 

- Adding lower and upper limit, 
	- 20 + 30 = 50 

2. The total surface area of a hemispherical solid having radius 7 cm is: **462 sq. cm**

Total surface are of square: $3\pi r^2$

$\therefore TSA = 3 \pi \times 7 = 462 sq. cm$

6. The graph of a linear polynomial $ax + b, a \neq 0$ is a 

7. Euclid's division lemma says -given positive intergers $a$ and $b$, there exists unique integers $q$ and $r$ satisfying $a - ... + ..., 0 \le r < b$

8. If $ax^2 + bx + k = 0$ has equal roots, then the value of k is
