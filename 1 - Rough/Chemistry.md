        - pH > 4.4 (basic) → Yellow

78. Bleaching powder is produced as per the reaction 
    1. $Ca(OH)_2 + Cl_2 \rightarrow CaOCl_2 + H_2O$
    2. $Ca(OH)_2 + Cl_2 \rightarrow Ca(OCl)_2 + H_2$
    3. $CaCl_2 + H_2O \rightarrow CaOCl_2 + H_2$
    4. $CaCl_2 + Ca(OH)_2 \rightarrow CaOCl_2 + H_2O$

$Ca(OH)_2 + Cl_2 \rightarrow CaOCl_2 + H_2O$

Chlorine gas is passed through slaked lime to obtain bleaching powder 

79. Correct order of reactivity series of the following four metals is 
    1. $Al<Zn<Fe<Cu$
    2. $Zn<Fe<Cu<Al$
    3. $Cu<Fe<Zn<Al$
    4. $Cu<Zn<Fe<Al$

- $Cu<Fe<Zn<Al$

80. Which of the following metal can be refined by distillations? 
    1. $Fe$
    2. $Cu$
    3. $Zn$
    4. $Al$

**Zinc** is preferred for distillation because: 
1. Low boiling point 
2. Vaporized without decomposition 

81. What is the common name of $NaOH$
    - Caustic soda 

82. The number of moles present in 22g of carbon dioxide is 
     - 0.5 mol 
     
83. What is the composition of bronze? 
    - **Copper**: ~88–95%
    - **Tin**: ~5–12%

84. Ozone layer depletion is caused by
    1. Fluorine 
    2. Oxygen 
    3. Chlorofluoro carbon 
    4. Nitrogen 

Chlorofluoro carbon depletes ozone layer. 

1. UV breakdown of CFC: 
    - $CCl_3F \overset{UV}{\rightarrow} CCl_2F + Cl^\cdot$
2. Chlorine radicals are highly reactive and attach to ozone: 
    - $Cl^\cdot + O_3 \rightarrow ClO^\cdot + O_2$
3. $ClO^\cdot$ reacts with atomic oxygen: 
    - $ClO^\cdot + O \rightarrow Cl^\cdot + O_2$

Therefore, it makes a self sustaining reaction that depletes the ozone layer. 

85. Which of the following is the electric configuration of noble gas? 
    1. 2, 8, 6 
    2. 2, 8, 7
    3. 2, 8, 5 
    4. 2, 8, 8 

**2, 8, 8** is the noble gas config since it has completely filled last shell. 

86. Which of the following compound is electrovalent? 
    1. $CH_4$
    2. $H_2O$
    3. $NH_2$
    4. $NaCl$

$NaCl$ forms electrovalent bond (ionic bond) since the rest are covalent bonds. 

87. Which among the following will turn blue litmus red? 
    1. $NH_4OH$
    2. $CH_3COOH$
    3. $KOH$
    4. $NaOH$

$CH_3COOH$ can turn the blue litmus red since it is an acid and the other are bases. 

88. The chemical name of blue vitriol is 
    1. Copper sulfate 
    2. Copper sulfate hemihydrate 
    3. Calcium sulfate dihydrate

    4. $X_2 Y_3 \text{ and } Y_3Z_2$

$X_2 Y_3 \text{ and } Y_3Z_2$ since $\text{Total Valency} \rightarrow \text{Positive valency} = \text{negative valency}$

91. Atomic number of element X is 11. The formula of chloride of X is 
    1. $XCl$ 
    2. $XCl_2$ 
    3. $X_3Cl$ 
    4. $X_3Cl_2$

$XCl$ is the compound formed since Chlorine only needs one electron to complete its octet

    1. Iron 
    2. Copper 
    3. Sodium 
    4. Aluminium 

Sodium is can be cutted with a knife since it is a soft metal with weak metallic bonding.
