# Tolerance 
The difference in between the actual hole size and shaft size is called tolerance. 

- It is of two types: 
    1. Unilateral Tolerance 
    2. Bilateral Tolerance

## Tolerance Grade 
With engineering fits, the tolerance will always be shown in alpha-numeric code. For example, a tole tolerance may be H7.

The capital letter signifies that we are dealing with a hole. When indicating tolerance for a shaft, the letter will be lowercase. The number shows the international tolerance grade (ISO 286).

A tolerance class determines a range of values the final measurement can vary from the base measurement. From the table, we can see that the tolerance grade applies to a range of basic sizes. 

So, if we have a hole with a nominal hole with a normal size of 25 mm and a tolerance class of $H_7$, we will fit into the 18...30 mm basic size group. The letter signifies the start of the tolerance zone. 

For $H_7$, the starting point is at exactly 25.000 mm. The maximum hole size is then 25.021 mm. For $F_7$, the tolerance range is the same, but the starting point is 25.020 mm, taking the last acceptable measurement to 25.041 mm. 

## Grade of Accuracy 

| Accuracy Grade | Permissible Error | 
|:-|:-|
| 5A (laboratory precision test gauges) | $\pm 0.05%$ of span | 
| 5AR (laboratory precision test gauges) | $\pm 0.05%$ of reading |
| 4A (laboratory precision test gauges) | $\pm 0.1%$ of span | 

This represents the joint accuracy. It means less tolerance and more accuracy. According to IS919-1993, total grade is 18 (01, 0, -1, to 16). $H_7/H_6$ means for fitting hole grade of accuracy 7 and a shaft of accuracy grade is 6.
