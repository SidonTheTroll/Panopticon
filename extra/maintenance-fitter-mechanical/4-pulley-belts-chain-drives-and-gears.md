# Pulley, Belts, Chain Drives & Gears 
# Pulley 
- A pulley is a simple machine consisting of a string (or rope) wrapped around a wheel (sometimes with a groove) with one end of the string attached to an object and the other end attached to a person or a motor.
- Pulleys may seem simple, but they can provide a powerful mechanical advantage, so lifting tasks may be done easily.
- An elevator is a modern engineering use of a pulley system that performs much like the raising of a large stone for pyramid building.
- Without the use of pulleys, an elevator would require a large motor to pull the cable straight up. 
- Instead of using a large motor, some elevators use a large weight that takes advantage of gravity to help raise the elevator.
- In this situation, the powering motor can be much smaller and only be used to determine the direction the elevator should go.
- Using a system of pulleys can be much more complex and provide a powerful mechanical advantage - greatly reducing the amount of force required to move an object.
- If one movable pulley is used, the amount of force required to raise the object attached to the movable pulley is cut in half.
- The trade-off is that the amount of rope required increases and the amount of rope that you must pull to raise the object is also increased.
- If two fixed pulleys are added to the system and a second movable pulley is attached to the object, the amount of force needed to raise the object becomes one-fourth of the object's weight, and four times as much rope is required.
- The powerful mechanical advantage of a pulley is in using many pulleys at once.
- Combining multiple pulleys decreases the amount of force necessary to move an object by increasing the amount of rope used to raise the object.
- The total amount of rope = original amount of rope multiplied by the number of pulleys.

## Types of Pulley 
- We know that a combination of pulley will result in the lesser amount of applied force and greater amount of work done.
- Therefore, pulleys are arranged in a way that some of them are fixed and some of them can move.
- Thus, pulley are of two types:
    1. Fixed Pulley
    2. Movable Pulley

### Fixed Pulley 
- The most commonly understood concept of a pulley is that it is a simple machine that redirects force.
- This means that by looping rope around a pulley and attaching the rope to an object, one pulls down on the rope to raise the object, instead of having to lift the object.
- A fixed pulley configuration is useful for raising an object to a level above your head.
- This type of pulley can also be used to balance an object, by attaching objects of equal weight to both sides of the rope, neither object moves.
- Once a force is applied to either side, the system continues moving in that direction.
- This kind of pulley system is used in some elevators.

### Movable Pulley 
- In a movable pulley system, the rope is attached to a fixed (non-moving) point, the pulley is attached to the object that you want to move and the other end of the rope is left free.
- By pulling on the rope, the pulley moves and the object raises.
- This type of system is good if you are trying to raise an object located below you to your level.
- In a variation, If both sides of a movable pulley system are fixed and the rope is taut between the fixed points, the system becomes like a wheel and axle because the object can ride along the rope if a force is applied to it. For example, a zip line.

# Belts 
## Belt Drive 
- A belt is a loop of flexible material used to link two or more rotating shafts mechanically, most often parallel.
- Belts may be used as a source of motion, to transmit power efficiently, or to track relative movement. The Belts are looped over pulleys and may have a twist between the pulleys, and the shafts need not be parallel. 
- In a two-pulley system, the belt can either drive normally in one direction (the same if on parallel shafts), or the belt may be crossed, so that the direction of the driven shaft is reversed. 
- As a source of motion, a conveyor belt is one application where the belt is adapted to carry a load continuously between two points.
- The belt drive can also be used to change the speed of rotation, either up or down, by using different pulleys. 
- There are seven different types of belt drive that can be found and those are: 
    1. Open belt drive 
    2. Closed or crossed belt drive 
    3. Fast or loose cone pulley 
    4. Stepped cone pulley 
    5. Jockey pulley drive 
    6. Quarter turn belt drive 
    7. Compound belt drive 

### Open Belt Drive 
- The open belt drive is used with shafts arrange parallel and rotating in the same direction. 
- In that case, the drive pulls the belt from one side and delivers it to the other side. 
- Thus, the tension in the lower side belt will be higher than the upper side belt. 
- The lower side belt is known as the tight side belt while the upper side belt is known as the slack side belt. 

### Closed or Crossed Belt Drive 
- Crossed or twisted belt drives are used with rotating shafts in parallel and opposite directions.
- In this case, the driver pulls the belt from one side and delivers it to the other side.
- Thus, the tension at the bottom belt will be higher than the upper side of the belt. 
- The belt is known as the tight side due to high tension, while the belt due to low tension is known as the slack side. 

### Fast or Loose Cone Pulley 
- This type of belt drives is used when the driven machine shaft is to be started or stopped whenever desired without interfering with the driving shaft. 
- A pulley which is used to the machine shaft is called a past pulley and run at the same speed as that of the machine shaft. 
- A loose pulley runs freely over the machine shaft and is capable of transmitting any power. 
- When the driven shaft is required to be stopped, the belt is pushed on to the loose pulley by means of a sliding bar having belt forks. 

### Stepped Cone Pulley Drive
- A step or cone pulley drive is used to change the speed of the driven shaft, while the main or driving shaft moves at a constant speed.
- This is accomplished by shifting the belt from one part of the steps to another.
- A step cone pulley is an integral casting consisting of three or different numbers of different sizes of pulleys adjacent to each other.
- A set of driven cone pulleys is placed upside down on the drive shaft. An endless belt will be wrapped around a pair of pulleys.
- By shifting the belt from one pair of pulleys to another, the speed of the driven shaft can be varied.
- The diameter of the pulleys driving and operated is such that the same belt will operate when transferred over pairs of different pulleys.

### Jockey Pulley Drive 
- In an open belt drive arrangement, if the center distance is small, or if the driven pulley is too small, the arc of the belt's contact with the driven pulley will be very small, which reduces the tension in the belt, or if the belt requires.
- Stress cannot be achieved by other methods, a sluggish pulley, called a jockey pulley, is placed on the slack side of the belt.
- This increases the arc of contact and thus stress resulting in an increase in power transmission.

### Quarter Turn Belt Drive 
- Quarter turn belt drives are also known as right angle belt drives.
- It is used with shafts arranged at right angles and rotating in a certain direction.
- To prevent the belt from leaving the pulley, the width of the face of the pulley must be greater than or equal to 1.4 b, where b is the width of the belt.
- If the pulley cannot be arranged or when reversible speed is desired, a quarter-turn belt drive with a guide pulley may be used.

### Compound Belt Drive 
- A compound belt drive is used when power is passed from one shaft to another through multiple shafts.

## Classification of Belt Drives 
- The belt drives can be classified into the following three groups: 
    1. **Light drives**: they are used as agricultural machines and small machine tools to transmit forces at belt speeds up to 10 m/s.
    2. **Medium drives**: they can transmit medium forces at belt speeds of more than 10 m/s but up to 22 m/s like machine tools. 
    3. **Heavy drives**: they are used in compressors and generators to transmit large forces at belt speeds above 22 m/s. 

## Types of Belts 
- There are four different types of belts: 
    1. **Round belts**: round belts are generally made of rubber. 
    2. **V belts**: V belts are arguably the most widely used belts in the industry. 
    3. **Flat belts**: Flat belts are also used to transmit power from one shaft to another. 
    4. **Timing/toothed belts**: Timing belts have teeth that fit into matching grooves on pulleys, ensuring precise and slip-free power transmission.

### Flat Belt
The flat belt transmits power using the friction output between the belt and the pulley. 

In a flat belt, the pulleys rotate in the same direction. 

They are usually classified as small woven endless belts or high strength flat belt.

- Woven endless belts are particularly useful, where minimal vibration is required. 
- High-strength flat belts are often useful because they reduce the load on the shaft bearings. 
- The materials used for high strength flat belts is a viscous resistant abrasive compound. 

### V Belt 
V-belts are mostly used in factories and workshops, where a large amount of power has to be transmitted, from one pulley to another, when two pulleys are very close to each other. 

- The V belt solved the slippage and alignment problem. 
- It is now the original belt for power transmission. 
- They provide the best combination of traction, movement speed, a load of bearings and longer service life. 

### Circular or Round Belt 
- The round belt is a circular cross-section belt designed to run in a pulley with 60-degree V-groove.
- Round grooves are only suitable for idler pulleys that guide the belt, or when O-ring type belts are used. 
- V-grooves transmit torque through palpation, which increases friction. 
- Round belts are only for cue in relatively low torque situations and can cut at various lengths and can join either by a staple, a metal connector or gluing. 
- Early sewing machines uses a leather belt, either attached to a metal staple or glued. 

### Timing Belt 
- Timing belts are positive transfer belts and can track relative movement 
- These belts have teeth that fit into a matched toothed pulley. 
- When properly stressed, they have no splippage, move at a constant speed, and are often used to transfer direct motion for the purposes of sequencing and timing. 
- They are often used instead of chains or gears, so noise is low, and a lubrication bath is not necessary. 
- Automobiles camshafts, short timing systems and stepper motors often use these belts. Timing belts need the least tension of all belts and are among the most efficient. 

## Applications of Belt Drive 
1. A belt drive is used for power transfer.
2. Drive to the rotor on the rotor spinning machine.
3. The belt drive is the used in conveyor. 
4. Drive to drafting rollers and other rolling elements on a single delivery drawing machine.
5. Drives to opening rollers, friction drums and take-off rollers on friction spinning machine. 
6. Main drive on the draw-texturing machine. 
7. The belt drive is used in the Mill industry. 
8. Drive to creel-rollers of a high-speed drawing machine. 

## Advantages of Belt Drive 
1. It is cost-effective and simple to use.
2. New belt-drive efficiency can be up to 95-98 percent. 
3. Belt drive requires low maintenance. 
4. Belt drives do not require a parallel shaft. 
5. They come with overload and jam protection. 
6. Speed difference can be obtained by using a step or tapered pulleys.
7. Belt drives are the most economical option when a large distance of power transmit is between shafts.
8. Damp out noise and vibration, load fluctuations are shock-absorbed, increasing the machinery life. 
9. Clutch action can be activated by releasing belt tension. 

## Disadvantages of Belt Drive 
1. Belt drives is not suitable for small distances.
2. There is a loss of performance due to high levels of slip and creep.
3. Constant velocity ratio cannot be achieved between drive and driven pulley.
4. It produces high noise.
5. It has low mechanical efficiency.

# Chain Drive
- A chain drive is a one way of transferring mechanical power from one place to another. 
- Chain drive is widely use in vehicle like bicycles and motorcycles, to transfer power to the wheels.
- It is also used in a wide variety of machines.
- Most often, the power is conveyed by a roller chain, known as the drive chain or transmission chain, passing over a sprocket gear, with the teeth of the gear meshing with the holes in the links of the chain.
- The gear is turned, and this pulls the chain putting mechanical force into the system.
- The chains are made up of a number of rigid links that joints to provide that are hinged together by pin flexibility needed to wrap driving and driven wheels.
- These wheels have special profile teeth and fit the corresponding recess in the chain link.
- Toothed wheels are known as sprocket wheels or bus sprockets.
- Sprockets and chains are thus constrained to move together without sliding and ensure the correct velocity ratio.

## Terminology of Chain Drive 
- Chain drives generally have 2 terms: 
    1. Chain pitch
    2. Pitch circle diameter of chain sprocket

### Chain Pitch 
- Chain Pitch: This is the distance between the hinge center of a link and the corresponding hinge center of an adjacent link.
- It is usually denoted by $p$.

### Pitch Circle Diameter of Chain Sprocket 
- This is the diameter of the circle on which the hinge centers of the chain lie when the chain is wrapped with a ball.
- The hinge centers of the chain and the circle drawn through these centers are called pitch circles and its diameter is known as pitch circle diameter. 

## Types of Chain Drive 
- There are three types of chain drives 
    1. Hoisting and Hauling chain drive 
    2. Conveyor chain drive 
    3. A power transmitting chain drive 

### Hoisting and Hauling Chain Drive 
- A hoist is a device for raising or lowering a load using a drum or a lifting wheel around which a rope or chain is wound.
- It can be operated manually, electrically, or pneumatically and can use chain, fiber, or wire ropes as a lifting medium.
- The best-known form is an elevator, the carriage of which is raised and lowered by a lifting mechanism.
- Most hoists are attached to their loads with a lifting hook.
- Hoisting and ruling chain are of the following two types:
    1. Chain with oval links
    2. Chains with square links

### Conveyor Chain Drive 
- A conveyor chain is a chain that has been specially developed for chain conveyor systems.
- It consists of a series of plain bearings that are held together by connecting plates.
- Each bearing consists of a pin and a bushing on which the chain roller rotates.
- These chains are used to continuously lift and convey materials at speeds up to 2 m/s.
- There are two types of conveyor chains:
    1. Detachable or hook joint type chain
    2. Closed joint type chain

### Power Transmitting Chain Drive 
- Power transmission chains are used for the transmission of mechanical power when the distance between the centers of shafts is short.
- These chains have provisions for efficient lubrication.
- The power transmitting chains are of the following three types:-
    1. Block or bush chain
    2. Bush roller chain
    3. Silent Chain

## Advantages of Chain Drive
1. They can be used for both long and short distances.
2. Several shafts and be driven from a single chain.
3. They are compact and have small overall dimensions.
4. Even in fire hazards it does not faces any bad problem.
5. Temperature and environmental conditions do not affect their working.

## Disadvantages of Chain Drive 
1. Chain Drive can not be used where slip is the system requirement.
2. It requires precise alignment compared to belt drives.
3. The production of chain drives is higher than belt drives.
4. Chain drive require frequent lubrication.
5. Load capacity less compared with gear drives.
6. Conventional chain drive suffers vibrations due to the chordal effect.
7. They can not be used where precise motion is required.
8. The chain drive needs accurate and careful mounting.
9. They require adjustments for slack like tensioning device.
10. They are not suitable for non-parallel shafts.

## Applications of Chain Drive
1. Chain drive device widely used for the transmission of power where shafts are separated at distances greater than that for which gears are practical.
2. Rigging and moving heavy materials.
3. Hydraulic lift truck fork operation.
4. Overhead hoists.
5. Increasing or decreasing a driver's output speed by altering gear ratios between the driver and the sprocket being driven
6. Operating conveyer belt
7. Chain drive used in several industries for several purposes like Transportation Industry, Agriculture Machinery, Material Handling Equipment, Building construction.

# Gears 
- A gear is a rotating circular machine part having cut teeth or, in the case of a cogwheel or gearwheel, inserted teeth (called cogs), which mesh with another toothed part to transmit torque.
- A gear is a type of machine element in which evenly spaced teeth are cut around cylindrical or conical surfaces.
- By interlocking a pair of these elements, they are used to transfer rotation and forces from the driveshaft to the driven shaft.
- Gear may also be known informally as a cog. An advantage of gears is that the teeth of a gear prevent slippage.

## Parts of a Gear
There are a few different terms related with gears. These are:

1. **Axis**: The axis of revolution of the gear, where the shaft passes through
2. **Teeth**: The jagged faces projecting outward from the circumference of the gear, used to transmit rotation to other gears.
3. **Pitch Circle**: The circle that defines the "size" of the gear. The pitch circles of two intermeshing gears must be tangential so that they can intermesh.
4. **Pitch Diameter**: The pitch diameter refers to the working diameter of the gear, a.k.a., the diameter of the pitch circle. The pitch diameter is used to calculate how far away two gears should be.
5. **Diametral Pitch**: The ratio of the number of teeth to the pitch diameter. Two gears must have the same diametrical pitch to mesh.
6. **Circular Pitch**: The distance from a point on one tooth to the same point on the adjacent tooth, measured along the pitch circle.
7. **Module**: The module of gear is simply the circular pitch divided by pi.
8. **Pressure Angle**: It is the angle between the line that defines the radius of the pitch circle and the point where the pitch circle intersects a tooth, and the line tangent to that tooth at that point.

## Types of Gear
There are many different types of gears such as:

1. Spur Gear
2. Helical Gear
3. Gear Rack
4. Bevel Gear
5. Spiral Bevel Gear
6. Screw Gear
7. Double Helical Gear
8. Herringbone Gear
9. Hypoid Gear
10. Miter Gear
11. Worm Gear

### Spur Gear 
- Spur gears are one of the most popular types of precision cylindrical gears.
- It feature a simple design of straight, parallel teeth positioned around the circumference of a - cylinder body with a central bore that fits over a shaft.
- These are used to transfer motion & power from one shaft to another in a mechanical setup.

### Helical Gear 
- Helical gears are one type of cylindrical gear with a slanted tooth trace.
- Compared to spur gears, they have a larger contact ratio and excel in quietness and less vibration, and are able to transmit large force.
- A pair of helical gears have the same helix angle but the helix hand is opposite.

### Gear Rack 
- Same sized & shaped teeth cut at equal distances along a straight rod is called a gear rack.
- A gear rack is a cylindrical gear with the radius of the pitch cylinder being infinite.
- By meshing with a cylindrica gear pinion, it converts rotational motion into linear motion.

### Bevel Gear
- A bevel gear is a toothed rotating machine element used to transfer mechanical energy or shaft power between shafts that are intersecting, either perpendicular or at an angle.
- This results in a change in the axis of rotation of the shaft power.
- A bevel gear can be imagined as a truncated cone.
- At its lateral side, teeth are milled which interlock to other gears with its own set of teeth.

### Spiral Bevel Gear 
- Spiral bevel gears are bevel gears with curved tooth lines.
- Due to the higher tooth contact ratio, they are superior to straight bevel gears in efficiency, strength, vibration, and noise.

### Screw Gear 
- Screw gears are a pair of same hand helical gears with the twist angle of 45° on non-parallel, non-intersecting shafts.
- Because the tooth contact is a point, their load carrying capacity is low and they are not suitable for large power transmission.
- Since power is transmitted by the sliding of the tooth surfaces, it is necessary to pay attention to lubrication when using these.

### Double Helical Gear
- Double helical gears are a variation of helical gears in which two helical faces are placed next to each other with a gap separating them. Each face has identical, but opposite, helix angles.
- Employing a double helical set of gears eliminates thrust loads & offers even greater tooth overlap & smoother operation.
- As the helical gear, double helical gears are commonly used in enclosed gear drives.

### Herringbone Gear 
- Herringbone gears are very similar to the double-helical gear, but they do not have a gap separating the two helical faces.
- Herringbone gears are typically smaller than the comparable double helical and are ideally suited for high shock and vibration applications.
- Herringbone gearing is not used very often due to its manufacturing difficulties and high cost.

### Hypoid Gear 
- Hypoid gears look very much like spiral bevel gear, but unlike spiral bevel gears, they operate on shafts that do not Intersect.
- In the hypoid arrangement, because the pinion is set on a different plane than the gear, the shafts are supported by the bearings on either end of the shaft.

### Miter Gear 
- Hypoid gears look very much like spiral bevel gear, but unlike spiral bevel gears, they operate on shafts that do not Intersect.
- In the hypoid arrangement, because the pinion is set on a different plane than the gear, the shafts are supported by the bearings on either end of the shaft.

### Worm Gear 
- A screw shape cut on a shaft is the worm, the mating gear is the worm wheel, and together on non-intersecting shafts is called a worm gear.
- Worms and worm wheels are not limited to cylindrical shapes.
- There is the hour-glass type which can increase the contact ratio, but production becomes more difficult.
- Due to the sliding contact of the gear surfaces, it is necessary to reduce friction.
- For this reason, generally, hard material is used for the worm, and soft material is used for the worm wheel.

## Advantages of gears
1. Gear drives provides large range of speed and torque for same Input power, with more accurate timing than a chain system does, less friction loss and noise.
2. Gear is positive drive; hence large velocity ratio can be obtained with minimum space.
3. Gears are mechanically strong, so higher loads can be lifted.
4. Gears are used for transmission of large H.F.
5. They are used for transmitting motion over small center distance of shafts
6. They are used for large reduction in speed and for transmission of torque.
7. Gears require only lubrication; hence less maintenance is required.
8. Using gear systems, we can transmit motion between non-parallel intersecting shafts.
9. They are used for positive drive, so its velocity ratio remains constant.
10. They have long life, so the gear system is very compact

## Disadvantages of Gears 
1. They are not suitable for large velocities.
2. They are not suitable for transmitting motion over a large distance.
3. Due to the engagement of toothed wheel of gears, some part of machine may get permanently damaged in case of excessive loading.
4. They have no flexibility.
5. Gear operation is noisy.
