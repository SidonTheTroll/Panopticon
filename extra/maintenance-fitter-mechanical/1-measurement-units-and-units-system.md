# Measurements, Units and Unit system 
## Measurements and Units 
In our day-to-day lifestyle, we need to measure things. For that, we need some measuring instruments which can measure the physical quantities in units. Units explain the number of things or substances we are measuring. It could be simple numbers, or it could be according to the weight of the substance.

There are two types of units:

1. Standard units
2. Derived units 

### Standard Unit
Standard units are the basic units of every physical quantity. For example, meter is the unit of length, kilogram is the unit of weight, second is the unit of time, etc. 

| Quantity measured/Physical Quantity | Base SI Unit | Symbol |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Mass | kilogram | kg | 
| Length | meter | m | 
| Temperature | Kelvin | K | 
| Amount of substance | mole | mol | 
| Electric current | ampere | A | 
| Time | second | s | 
| Luminous intensity | candela | cd | 

### Derived Units 

Derived units are basically the combination of standard units when they come in relation with each other. For example, m/sec is the derived unit of speed where length and time are interrelated, etc.

| Quantity | Unit | Symbol |
| :- | :- | :- |
| Volume | cubic meter | $m^3$ |
| Density | kilogram per cubic meter | $kg/m^3$ |
| Speed | meter per second | $m/s$ |
| Newton | $kg m/s^2$ | $N$ |
| Energy | Joule $(kg m^2/s^2)$ | J | 
| Pressure | Pascal $(kg/(ms^2))$ | $Pa$ | 

## Unit System 
We know that basic quantities are measured in standard units. However, standard units are different over the places. Therefore, a measuring unit system is designed which is followed all over the world.

There are three types of measuring system. These are: 

| System | Length | Mass | Time |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| M.K.S | meter | kilogram | second |
| F.P.S System | foot | pound | second | 
| C.G.S System | centimeter | gram | second | 

## International Unit System 
International Standard of measurement uses different parameters. For example, pressure, which is defined as force per unit area. So, its units are $N/m^2,\ \text{Psi},\ \text{Bar},\ \text{Pascal},$ etc.

| Type | Definition | Application Examples |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Gauge | Reference to atmospheric pressure | Car tire, water level measurement, chamber pressure, hydraulic applications |
| Sealed | Reference to a sealed chamber cleared with atmospheric pressure (approx. 1 bar) | For used in aggressive media, industrial applications, washdown environments, food and beverage | 
| Absolute | To reference in a vacuum (0 bar or no pressure) | Barometric, weather stations and metrological applications | 
| Differential | Measuring the difference between two pressure part readings. | Filter and pump monitoring, air conditioner, HVAC Ventilation and Air conditioning, Clean room monitoring. | 

### Measurement of Pressure 
The Pressure is measured in different units for different aspects of work. It is measured in $Psi$ for air, $N/m^2$ for any force. Therefore, absolute pressure is measured by addition or subtraction of gauge pressure and pressure vacuum.

$$
\text{Absolute Pressure} = \text{Gauge Pressure} \pm \text{Pressure Vacuum}
$$

### Measurement of Temperature
The temperature is measured in $\degree C$ or $\degree F$ and absolute temperature. The raised level of mercury in the column indicates the temperature. In clinical thermometer, temperature starts from $32 \degree F$. In laboratory thermometer, temperature starts from $0 \degree C$.
