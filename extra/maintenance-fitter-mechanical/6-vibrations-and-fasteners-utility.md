# Vibrations and Fasteners Utility 
- Vibration can be defined as simply the cyclic or oscillating motion of a machine or machine component from its position of rest. <img align=right src="./img/6/vibrations.jpg" width=200>
- However, vibration can indicate a problem and if left unchecked can cause damage or expedited deterioration.

## Causes of Vibrations
- There are many factors which cause the machine to vibrate. Some of them are: -
    1. Imbalance in the machine parts.
    2. Misalignment of the machine while mounting.
    3. Wearing and tearing of the components.
    4. Looseness of the machine parts like belts, chains, etc.

### Imbalance 
- If a rotating component has what is known as a heavy spot this can cause machine vibration, this increases exponentially with speed. <img align=right src="./img/6/imbalance.jpg" width=200>
- Imbalance is when the shafts geometric centerline and mass centerline do not coincide.
- The reason for this is because the heavy spot will force the mass centreline off the geometric centreline.
- Imbalance can be caused by a few different things, such as:
    1. maintenance issues: missing balance weights or dirty or deformed fan blades.
    2. manufacturing defects including casting flaws or machining errors.
- The effects of an imbalance increases with machine's speed.
- The biggest concern with imbalance is that it can cause unnecessary machine vibration and drastically reduce the operational life of bearings.

### Misalignment
- A common cause of machine vibration is when the machine shafts that are out of line. <img align=right src="./img/6/misalignment.jpg" width=200>
- Misalignment is a root cause of many machine breakdowns, bearing failures, and damaged seals, shafts and couplings.
- In fact, it is widely believed that over 50% of machine failures are due to misalignment.
- Misalignment does not have one single cause but can be a combination of causes. It can happen:
    1. By developing over time (wear)
    2. During the assembly process
    3. Not considering thermal expansion during the alignment process
    4. Not being reassembled properly after maintenance
    5. Because of shifting components (structural issues)

### Wearing and Tearing 
- When rotating components like roller or ball bearings, gears, or drive belts, start to show signs of wear, the machine vibrates. <img align=right src="./img/6/wearing-and-tearing.jpg" width=300>
- For example, if a roller bearing race becomes pitted, then the bearing rollers will generate impact and friction causes machine to vibrate.
- This occurs as the rolling elements travel over the section of pitted race.
- Other examples of wear causing vibration include: a drive belt breaking down, or a heavily worn or chipped gear tooth.

### Looseness 
- Looseness can be rotating or mechanically generated. <img align=right src="./img/6/looseness-1.jpg" width=250>
- There are three types of Mechanical looseness to consider:
    1. Rotating looseness
    2. Structural looseness (foundation flexibility)
    3. Non-rotating looseness.
- Rotating looseness can occur due to wear in a bearing. <img align=right src="./img/6/looseness-2.jpg" width=250>
- The problem with looseness is that irrespective of what caused it, looseness can cause damage such as: fatigue and wear in equipment mounts and further bearing wear.
- It can become very dangerous and destructive if a vibrating component is either loosely attached to its mounts, or has loose bearings.

## Vibration Effect 
- Some of the vibration effects are: 
    1. Vibration can accelerate machine wear, consume excess power, and cause equipment to be taken out of service, resulting in unplanned downtime.
2. Other effects of vibration include safety issues and diminished working conditions.
    3. When measured and analysed properly, however, vibration can play an important role in preventive maintenance programs.
    4. It can serve as an indicator of machine condition and allow plant maintenance professionals to act before damage or disaster strike

## Corrective Methods of Vibrations 
There are few ways to correctly treat machine vibration problems, these include:

1. Precision balancing
2. Bearing replacement
3. Identifying any additional bad parts and having them sourced then replaced.
4. Precision Alignment
5. Precision Lubrication.
6. Dissemble, inspect visually, clean, and then reassemble, this can help to fix some of the more elusive problems. Stiffening and mass loading to reduce measured vibration.

# Fasteners 
- A fastener is a non-permanent or permanent mechanical tool that rigidly connects or affixes two surfaces on objects together.

<img src="./img/6/tubular-rivets.jpg" width=200>

#### Blind Rivets 
- Blind rivets, or pop rivets, are a tubular rivet with a mandrel down the center.
- They are installed where there isn't access to the back side of the materials being Joined.
- The rivet is inserted into a hole and the mandrel is pulled out using a special tool As the mandrel leaves, it folds the tube against the side of the inner surface.

<img src="img/6/blind-rivet.jpg" width=200>

#### Drive Rivets 
- A drive rivet is a form of blind rivet with a shorter mandrel, and it is hammered in to make the connection.
- As the rivet is hammered, the shank expands to seal the connection on the inner surface of the material.

<img src="./img/6/drive-rivet.jpg" width=200>

#### Split Rivets
- A split rivet, or bifurcated rivet, is a self-piercing rivet that has split legs attached to the head of the rivet.
- The pre-split shaft is placed into a hole and pounded.
- The force of the pounding causes the legs to spread and secure the connection.

<img src="./img/6/split-rivet.jpg" width=200>

## Auxiliary Fasteners 
### Washers 
- Washers are a small, circular, metal disc in the shape of an annulus, halo, donut, or ring that is used to distribute the force of a screw, bolt, or nut.
- They can relieve friction, stop leakages, maintain tension, prevent corrosion, and serve as a spacer or separator.
- The wide and varied uses of washers has made them a necessity in a number of applications.
- Types of Washers
    1. Plain Washer
    2. Spring Washer
    3. Lock Washer
- In each of the categories are specialized forms that are designed to serve a specific or unusual function.

#### Plain Washer 
- The purpose of plain washers is to isolate the material being secured from a bolt, screw, or nut.
- They may serve the purpose of insulation or be a means of protecting the substrate.
- Another function of plain washers is to distribute the load by increasing the surface area that contacts the substrate.
- If a hole is too large, a washer can make up for the size difference.

<img src="./img/6/plain-washer.jpg" width=200>

#### Flat Washer 
- A flat washer is referred to as type A and is for general use in correcting hole size and distributing the load.

<img src="./img/6/flat-washer.jpg" width=200>

#### Locking Washer 
- Locking washers are an excellent tool for locking bolts, nuts, and screws in place where there is a chance of a connection becoming loose due to friction, shock, rotation, or vibrations.
- They exert a spring tension on a fastener that keeps it from loosening. Locking washers are placed beneath the fastener as an extra measure of security.

<img src="./img/6/locking-washer.jpg" width=200>

#### External Teeth Washer
- The teeth for an external locking washer are around the circumference of the washer and extend radially outward.
- When the nut, bolt, or screw is tightened, the external teeth bite into the surface of the substrate to hold the fastener tightly in place.

<img src="./img/6/external-teeth-washer.jpg" width=200>

#### Internal Teeth Washer
- For an internal tooth locking washer, the teeth are on the inner diameter of the washer and extend toward the center of the washer.
- Just like in the external tooth locking washer, as the fastener is tightened, internal teeth dig into the substrate to lock the fastener in place.

<img src="img/6/internal-teeth-washer.jpg" width=200>

#### Split Lock Washer 
- Split lock washers have helical shaped split rings that exert spring force on the fastener that creates Increased friction and motion resistance.
