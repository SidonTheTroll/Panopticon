# What is Welding?

Welding is technique of metal joining process in between two pieces of similar or dissimilar metals, by the permanent way with the help of a suitable heat. The welding may be done with or without the application of pressure and with or without the use of filler metal.

## Classification of Welding Process on Methods

Welding process may be broadly classified under two main headings:

1. Fusion or Non Prussure Welding:
   - For example:
     1. Arc Welding: metallic arc welding, carbon arc welding
     2. Gas Welding: oxy-acetylene, oxy-hydrogen
2. Pressure Welding or Non-fusion Welding:
   - For example
     1. Resistance welding
     2. Forge welding

## Safety Precautions for Arc Welding

1. Don't make welding without cleaning nicely the work pieces.
2. Do not touch the hot job with naked hand.
3. Do not see the arc rays through naked eye.
4. Don't weld continiously on the size of white washed wall because arc rays reflect from white washed wall.
5. Keep dry sand and water to put off the fire in welding shop.
6. Do not run the machine, if there is no work.
7. Rubbing the electrode from right hand to left hand when the electrode stick (touch) the job.
8. Don't weld without final preparation of the job.
9. While chipping the welding beads, use chipping goggles.
10. Don't keep the coated electrode in damp place, otherwise the flux coating may be damaged.
11. Don't weld or join any kind of work or job without knowing the metal character.

- **Welding Transformer**: the voltage range that is employed in arc welding in AC supply is normally from 80 to 100 volts, but the main supply of power in the factories is at 220 to 440 volts. A device is therefore used to change the higher voltage of main supply to lower voltage for welding. Such a device is called transformer. The AC welding transformer can never be operated without AC main supply. The transformer is of two types:

  1. **Step up transformer**: The transformer used for raising the voltage is called step up transformer.
  2. **Step down transformer**: The transformer is used to lower the voltage. So it is called step down transformer.
- **Generator**: Generator is a source of electrical energy supply. Generator gives electricity when it is run with a prime motor like turbine, engine or motor. A generator may be an AC or DC generator to give AC or DC type of electricity respectivel. Then input to a generator is mechanical torque and its output is electric current.
- **Motor**: Motor is just reverse of generator is the sense that it is fed with electricity and converts the electrical energy into the mechanical energy. Its out-put is mechanical torque. Motor may be AC or DC type.
- **DC Welding Motor Generator**: That device, which works with the help of a motor in electric arc welding is called DC generator. In DC generator, there is a set of motor and generator which are fitted on the same shaft. The motor of this set can be easily operated by AC supply. In this set, the arc voltage is kept in between 15 volts to 45 volts, while in open circuit to make the arc easily, the voltage is kept between 60 to 100 volts. In DC generator, we can get the current of voltage from 20 to 1000 amps according to requirement.
- **AC/DC welding Rectifier**:- It is a device of electric arc welding, in which both type of AC and DC current are used. It is a step-down transformer, output is connected with the rectifier unit, which change the AC supply to DC supply. The output of DC supply is connected with the negative and positive terminals. The supply for welding process is taken from here by the welding cables. It can be designed specially to provide the AC welding supply or DC welding supply with the help of an operating switch, which is fitted on rectifier machine.
