# Welding
- Welding is the process of joining two metal pieces without the use of dissimilar or adhesive filler. 

or 

- Welding is the process/technique of joining metal where heat and/or pressure is used to join them permanently. 

# Safety

## Machine Safety 
1. Machine should be kept in dry and flat place. 
2. Necessary tools should be available to operate the machine. 
3. Equipment should be well-maintained. 
4. Basic knowledge about machine should be known. 
    1. Know its present status 
    2. Check wire connection in the machine and make sure no fault or cross-connection is active. 
    3. Power connection shouldn't be active while moving the machine. 

## Work Safety 
1. Eyewear should be used to protect the eyes from harmful rays. 
2. Face mask can protect the face from heat. 
3. Face mask can also protect our lungs from flux gas. 
4. Hand gloves made from leather helps protect the hands from radiating heat. 
5. Leather apron protects the torso from heat. 
6. Tongs are used to handle hot jobs. 

# Types of Welding 
- There are two types of welding based on working principle: 
    1. Fusion Welding
    2. Non-Fusion Welding 

## Non-Fusion Welding 
- **Spoke/Electrode Welding**: Metal pieces placed between two active electrodes heat up and joined with pressure. 
- **Resistance welding**: Uses delivered heat to heat up metal and clamp them together with pressure.
- **Friction Welding**: Joins metal using mechanical friction cause by intense rubbing of the two pieces and pressing them together.  
- **Laser Beam Welding**: high powered laser is used to heat up the pieces and then they are pressed so that they can join together. 

## Fusion Welding 
- **Arc Welding**: it is done by electricity by melting the metal using sparks from electrode. 
    1. **Manual Metal Arc Welding (SMAW)**: Also known as "stick" welding, it uses a consumable electrode covered in flux.
    2. **Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW)**: Uses a continuous wire electrode and shielding gas.
    3. **Flux Cored Arc Welding (FCAW)**: Similar to GMAW but uses a tubular wire filled with flux.
    4. **Electroslag Welding (ESW)**: Used for joining thick steel plates, it employs a continuous wire electrode and a slag cover.
    5. Submerged Arc Welding (SAW): As mentioned earlier, uses a continuous wire electrode under a layer of flux.
- **Gas Welding**: it is the welding done by using fuel gas and an oxidizing agent to create flame that joins metals by heating them up to the melting point. 

### Manual Metal Arc Welding 
This uses 220 V or 440 V volt and steps them down using a transformer, minimizing voltage used and risk. A rectifier can also be used to convert AC into DC. 

- Two electrodes are used to create spark and generates heat to melt the metal and fuses after cooling down. 

> [!NOTE]
> Flame of flame gas welding should be twice the melting point of the metal to melt them easily. Eg: if the melting point is around 1200 - 1650 degree Celsius, then the flame will be 2800 - 3000 degree Celsius. 

## Types of Metal Joining 
1. **Welding**: it's a permanent way of metal joining by melting and fusing the metal pieces. 
2. **Bolting**: temporary way of joining by using nuts and bolts.
3. **Riveting**: temporary way of joining 2 metal pieces using rivets. 
4. **Grooving**: temporary way of joint metal by creating a groove or channel to fix them together. 
5. **Shouldering**: semi-permanent way of joining 2 metal pieces by using a third soft metal to act as glue. 
6. **Brazing**: semi-permanent way of joining 2 metal pieces by melting a filler metal between them. 

## Work Positioning 
- Proper work positioning provides comfort while working and some advantage. 

- Types of Work Positioning
    1. Downhead position 
    2. Flat position
    3. Vertical position 
    4. Horizontal position 
    5. Inclined position 
    6. Overhead position 

### Downhead Position 
- Electrode is kept at 70 degree to 80 degree to the job so that the molten metal isnt displaced.
- Electrode and holder should be kept at 120 degree angle for body support and view. 

### Flat Positioning 
- Hold the electrode at a flat angle of 10° to 15° from vertical, tilted slightly in the direction of welding.
- Electrode-to-job angle should be approximately 70° to 80°.
- Maintain a consistent arc and avoid excessive weaving.

### Vertical Positioning 
- High current melts the metal out of the weld zone, therefore, it is kept at 90 amps or less. 
- Job to electrode: 90 degree 
- Electrode to holder: 90 degree 

### Horizontal Positioning 
- Upper metal piece should be in focus with the electrode. 
- Below 45 degree angle should be between electrode and job piece at sideway position. 

### Inclined Positioning 
- When welding on an inclined surface, adjust the angle of the electrode to counteract gravity and ensure even weld flow.
- Maintain an electrode-to-job angle of 60° to 70°, depending on the steepness of the incline.
- Keep the electrode holder at an angle that provides stability and clear visibility, typically around 100° to 120° from the body.

### Overhead Positon 
- Current should be below 80 amps so that the metal doesn't drip on you. 
- Electrode-to-job angle: 70° to 80°, to control the molten pool and prevent sagging or drips.
- Electrode holder angle: About 120° from the body, allowing steady hand support and clear view of the arc.
- Use fast travel speed to prevent molten metal from falling out of the weld joint.
