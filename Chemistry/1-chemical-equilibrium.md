## Characteristics of Chemical Equilibrium 
1. An Equilibrium is attained only in a closed vessel in a certain temperature. Eg: $CaCO_3 \leftrightarrows CaO + CO_2 (\uparrow)$, since $CO_2$ will escape if container is open, and the equation will no longer be reversible. 
2. Chemical Equilibrium can be attained from both directions, i.e., forward and backward. 
3. Rate of forward reaction is equal to the rate of backwarrd reaction in reversible reaction, i.e., chemical equilibrium. Eg: $CaCO_3 \overset{R_f}{\underset{R_b}{\leftrightarrows}} CaO + CO_2 (\uparrow)$
4. Chemical equilibrium is **dynamic** in nature. Because buring reaction, the concentration of rate of reactants decrease and that of product increases till the equilibrium is attained.
5. At equilibrium, it appears that the reaction has stopped but practically, the reaction is still occuring with same rate of forward and backward direction. 
6. A catalyst has no effect on the state of equilibrium. It normally increases the rate of both forward and backward reaction. It helps to **attain equilibrium quickly to same extent**. 

- **Catalyst:** it is a substance that can increase or decrease the rate of reaction without being consumed in the reaction. 


$$
\text{Concentration} = \frac{\text{No. of Moles}(n)}{\text{Volume}(V)} 
$$

## Laws of Mass Action 
$$
\underset{\text{Reactant}}{A+B} \leftrightarrows \underset{\text{Product}}{C+D}
$$ 

A Mixture of reactants and products in equilibrium state are known as **equilibrium mixture**. 

- It states that the rate of chemical reaction is directly proportional to the multiplication product of active masses at **constant temperature**.

$$
R_f \propto [A][B] \implies R_f = K_f [A][B]
\\ 
R_b \propto [C][D] \implies R_b = K_b [C][D]
$$

According to equation, 

$R_f = R_b$  
$\implies K_f [A][B] = K_b [C][D]$  
$\implies \frac{K_f}{K_b} = \frac{[C][D]}{[A][B]}$  
$\implies K_c = \frac{[C][D]}{[A][B]}$  

$$
aA + bB \overset{R_f}{\underset{R_b}{\leftrightarrows}} cC + dD 
$$

For reactions having stoichiometric coefficient, 

$$
\text{Rate of reaction} \propto \text{Multiplication of concentration raised to power of their coefficients}
$$

$R_f \propto [A]^a[B]^b = K_f [A]^a[B]^b$  
$R_b \propto [C]^c[D]^d = K_b [C]^c[D]^d$  
$\implies \frac{K_f}{K_b} = \frac{[C]^c[D]^d}{[A]^a[B]^b}$  
$\implies K_C = \frac{[C]^c[D]^d}{[A]^a[B]^b}$


- Equilibrium constant is the ratio of multiplication of concentration of products by that of reactants raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients. 

$PV = nRT$

- **P**: Pressure 
- **V**: Volume 
- **n**: No. of moles 
- **R**: Gas constant
- **T**: Temperature 

$P = \frac{nRT}{V}$  
$P = CRT$  
$P \propto C$

$aA + bB \leftrightarrows cC + dD$
$K_p = \frac{P_C^c P_D^d}{P_A^a P_B^b}$

$4NH_3 + 5O_2 \leftrightarrows 4NO + 6H_2O$

$K_C = \frac{[NO]^4[H_2O]^6}{[NH_3]^4[O_2]^5}$  
$K_P = \frac{[P_{NO}]^4[P_{H_2O}]^6}{[P_{NH_3}]^4[P_{O_2}]^5}$

$aA + bB \leftrightarrows cC + dD$

$P = CRT$

- $P_A = [A]RT$
- $P_B = [B]RT$
- $P_C = [C]RT$
- $P_D = [D]RT$

$K_P = \frac{P_C^c P_D^d}{P_A^a P_B^b}$  
$\implies \frac{ {[C]RT}^C {[D]RT}^d } { {[A]RT^a} {[B]RT}^b }$  
$\implies \frac{[C]^c [D]^d}{[A]^a [B]^b}$  
$\implies \frac{(RT)^{c+d}}{(RT)^{a+b}}$  
$\implies K_C = (RT)^{(c+d)-(a+b)}$  
$\implies K_p = K_C (RT)^{\Delta ng}$  
$\Delta ng = (c+d)-(a+b)$

$2 A(g) = B(g) + C (g)$  
$A ng = (1+1)-2$  
$A = 0$
$K_P = K_C (RT)^{\Delta ng}$  
$\implies K_C (RT)^0$  
$K_P = K_C\times 1$  
$\therefore K_P = K_C$

## Le Chatelier's Principle 

It states that if a system in equilibrium is subjected to a change in concentration, temperature or pressure. The equilibrium shifts in such a way so as to undo the effect of the system. 

### Effect of Change in Concentration
When the concentration of any of the reactant or product at equilibrium is changed, the composition of equilibrium mixture changes so as to minimize the effect of concentration changed. 

$$
H_2 + I_2 \leftrightarrow 2HI 
$$

If we increase the concentration of $H$ or $I$, the equilibrium is disturbed and to restore the equilibrium, forward reaction will try to reduce the concentration of $H$ or $I$ to restore the equilibrium. 

Similarly, if we decrease the concentration of $HI$, the reaction will try to increase its concentration, so the reaction will go forward. 

### Effect of Change in Pressure 
$$
PV = nRT
$$

If volume and temperature are constant, 

$P \propto n$

$\therefore \text{The more moles are present, the higher pressure there is}$  
$N_2O_4 (g) \leftrightarrows 2NO_2 (g)$ 

If pressure increases, backward reaction will take place to decrease the number of moles in the direction of less moles. So, backward reaction will take place. 

And vice versa if pressure decreases and forward reaction will take place. 

### Effect of Change in Temperature 

| S. No. | Exothermic | Endothermic | 
|-|-|-|
| 1. | Heat released during reaction | Heat absorbed during reaction. | 
| Eg. | $C (s) + O (g) \leftrightarrows CO_2 + \Delta$ | $\text{Melting of ice and } CaCO_3 + \Delta \leftrightarrows CaO + CO_2$ | 
| 2. | Forward reaction is favored by low temperature | Forward reaction is favored by high temperature. | 
| 3. Catalyst cannot change the concentration of any side | Catalyst cannot change the concentration of any side. | 

## Electrolite 
- Breaks down (dissociates) into ions when dissolved in water. 

$$
NaCl + H_2O \rightarrow Na^+ (aq) + Cl^- (aq) 
$$

## Non-Electrolite 
- Doesn't dissociate into ions when dissolved in water. 

$C_6H_{12}O_6$ 

| S. No. | Strong Electrolite | Weak Electrolite | 
|-|-|-|
| 1. | Completely dissociates into ions. | Cannot dissociate completely in water. | 
| Eg: | $NaCl + H_2O \rightarrow Na^+ Cl^-$ | $CH_3COOH + H_2O \leftrightarrow CH_3COO^- + H^+$ | 
| 2. | Equilibrium is not possible | Equilibrium is possible | 

## Degree of Dissociation $\alpha$
$$
\underset{100-5}{CH_3COOH} + H_2O \leftrightarrows \underset{5}{CH_3COO^-} + \underset{5}{H^+} 
\therefore \text{Dissociation} = 5/100
$$

$\therefore$ The fraction of the total number of molecules of an electrolite that dissociate into its ions is called Degree of Dissociation. 

$\alpha \frac{\text{Number of ionized molecules}}{\text{Total number of molecules}}$

$1 mol = \alpha$  
$2 mol = 2 \alpha$  
$3 mol = 3 \alpha$  
$C mol = C \alpha$ 

$$
\underset{C - C\alpha}{CH_3COOH} + H_2O \underset{C\alpha}{CH_3COO^-} + \underset{C\alpha}{H^+}   
$$

$K_C = \frac{[CH_3COO^-][H^+]}{[CH_3COOH][H_2O]}$  
$K_C[H_2O] = \frac{[CH_3COO^-][H^+]}{[CH_3COOH]}$  
$K = \frac{[CH_3COO^-][H^+]}{[CH_3COOH]}$  
$K = \frac{C\alpha \times C\alpha}{C-C\alpha}$  
$\implies \frac{C \alpha \times C \alpha}{C(1-\alpha)}$  
$K_{a/b} = \frac{C\alpha}{1 - \alpha}$

$1 - \alpha \approx 1$  
$K = C \alpha^2$  
$\implies \alpha = \frac{K}{C}$  
$\therefore \alpha = \sqrt{K/C}$

> The dissociation constant of 0.2 M acetic acid is $1.7 \times 10^{-5} M$ at 298 K. Calculate its degree of dissociation and hydrogen ion concentration. 

Given:  
$C = 0.2 M$  
$T = 298 K$  
$K = 1.7 \times 10^_{-5} M$ 

$\alpha^2 = \frac{1.7 \times 10^{-5}}{0.2}$  
$\alpha = 0.00922$ 

$$
\underset{C-C\alpha}{CH_3COOH} \leftrightarrows \underset{C\alpha}{CH_3COO^} - + \underset{C\alpha}{H^+}
$$

$H^+ = C\alpha$  
$\implies 0.2 \times 0.00922$  
$\implies 0.001844 M$

## Ionic Product of Water 
$$
H_2O \underset{R_b}{\overset{R_f}{\leftrightarrows}} H^+ + OH^-
$$ 

$K = \frac{[H^+][OH^-]}{[H_2O]}$

$K[H_2O] = [H^+] [OH^-]$

$\therefore K_W = [H^+] [OH^-]$  
$[K_W] = K[H_2O]$ 

At 298K,  
$K_W = 10^{-14} M^2$

$\underset{C - C\alpha}{H_2O} \leftrightarrows \underset{C\alpha}{H^+} + \underset{C\alpha}{OH^+}$

$\therefore [H^+] = [OH^-]$  
$\therefore [H^+] + [OH^-] = 10^{14}$

$\therefore [H^+] = [OH^-] = 10^{-7} M \text{at 298 K}$

$[H^+]\uparrow = \text{acidic}$  
$OH^\uparrow = \text{basic}$

## pH 
- pH can be defined as -ve log of $H^+$ ion concentration. 

$\therefore pH = -\log [H^+]$

$K_W = [H^+][OH^-]$  
$\log K_W = \log [H^+][OH^-]$  
$\log K_W = \log [H^+][OH^-]$  
$\log K_W = \log [H^+] + \log [OH^-]$
$-\log K_W = -\log [H^+] - \log [OH^-]$  
$pK_W = pH + pOH$

$\therefore P^{K_W} = p^H = p^{OH}$  
$\because p^{K_W} = -\log K_W$  
$\implies -\log 10^{-14}$  
$\implies +14$

> $HCl \rightarrow [H^+] = 10^{-5}$ Find pH. 

$pH = -\log [H^+]$  
$\implies -\log 10^{-5}$  
$\implies -(-5) \log 10$
$\implies 5$

> If $HCl \rightarrow H^+ = 2 \times 10^{-4}$ Find pH 

$pH = - \log [H^+]$  
$\implies -\log (2\times 10^{-4})$  
$\implies -\log 2 + (-\log 10^{-4})$  
$\implies -\log 2 + [-(-4)\log 10]$
$\implies -\log 2 + 4 \log 10$
$\implies -0.301 + 4$  
$\implies 3.699 M$
