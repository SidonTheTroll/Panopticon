# Orthographic Projection 
- **Point**: It is a dot which has no length, width and thickness. It represents any position of a body. 
- **Straight line**: it is a combination or collection of points. 
- **Plane**: it is a 2D body which only has length and breadth and negligible thickness. Rephrased as, it is a collection of equal straight lines. 
- **Plane of Projection**: it is a plane where the ray of sight is projected. 
- **Projector**: the lines that connect the object to the plane of projection. It is always normal to the plane. 
- **Orthographic Projection**: when the projectors are parallel to each other and also perpendicular to the plane, the projection is called orthographic projection. 

## Methods of Projection 
1. Orthographic Projection 
2. Oblique Projection
3. Isometric Projection 
4. Perspective Projection 

### Orthographic Projection 
- Objects are placed either in 1st or 3rd quadrant.

- Front View is also called **Elevation View**. 
- Top View is also called **plan**. 
- The horizontal plane is made normal to reference, i.e., vertical plane. 
- **Auxiliary Vertical Plane**: plane perpendicular to both horizontal plane and vertical plane.
