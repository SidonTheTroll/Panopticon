# Scales 
- Modes
    1. **Full size scale**: when drawings are drawn in exact measurements as the object represented, it is called full size drawing/scale. E.g.: 250 mm long pencil can be drawn by drawing a length of 250 mm. 
    2. **Reducing Scale**: drawing are drawn proportionally smaller than the object represented. E.g.: houses, bridges, large machines, buildings, etc. 
    3. **Enlarging Scale**: drawings are drawn proportionally larger than their real size. E.g.: small machine parts, mathematical instruments, etc. 

- Types 
    1. **Engineer Scale**: A specialized scale used in engineering drawings, usually graduated in ratios (like 1:10, 1:20, etc.) for direct reading of reduced or enlarged dimensions.
    2. **Graphical Scale**: Allows measurement of smaller subdivisions (e.g., tenths of a cm) with higher precision by using diagonals.
    3. **Plain Scale**: Shows only one unit (like centimeters or inches) and its subdivisions. Used for straightforward measurements.

- Types of Scales by Construction/Design
    1. **Plain Scale**: A simple scale that shows units and their immediate subdivisions (e.g., cm and mm).
    2. **Diagonal Scale**: A scale used to measure three units (e.g., m, dm, cm) or very small subdivisions accurately using diagonals.
    3. **Comparative Scale**: A scale that compares measurements in two different systems/units (e.g., cm and inches).
    4. **Vernier Scale**: A precise scale that uses a vernier to measure small fractions of the smallest division of the main scale.
    5. **Scale of Chords**: A special scale used to measure or set out angles using the lengths of chords of a circle.
    6. **Isometric Scale**: A scale used in isometric drawings to show true measurements along isometric axes, accounting for foreshortening.
