- **Charge**: the amount of electron lost or gained by matter. 
- Types of charge: 
    1. Positive: from excess of proton 
    2. Negative: from excess of electron 
- Like charges repel, and similar charges attract. 

## Basic Properties of Electric Charge 
1. **Charges are conserved**: charges can neither be created nor be destroyed. 
2. **Additive nature of charge**: according to this property, if a system contains *n* no. of charges, $Q_1$, $Q_2$... $Q_n$, then total charge is Q; $Q = Q_1 + Q_2 +.... + Q_n$
3. **Quantization of Charge**: all free charges are integral multiple of a basic unit of charge denoted by *e*. Thus total charge is '$Q = ne$'; $n = 1,2,...; e = 1.6 \times 10^{19}C$

## Coulomb's Law/Inverse Square Law 
The force of attraction or repulsion between any two point charge is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the distance between them.  
Let $F$ be the force acting between 2 charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ separated by a distance $r$

$$
\therefore F \propto \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \\ 
F = k \frac{q_1q_2}{r_2}
$$

$k$ is known as **electrostatic force constant**. Its value depends upon the nature of the medium and the system of units.  

When the charges are separated by free space,  
Then, 

$\text{In CGS unit, }k = 1$  
$\text{In SI unit, }k = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}$

$$
\therefore \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0 \frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}}
$$
