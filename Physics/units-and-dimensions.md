# Units and Dimensions 
- **Physical Quantities**: the characteristics or properties of a physical system that can be measured or calculated, e.g.: length, breadth, mass, height, time, temperature, etc.

- Reference standards/units should be used along quantities to define certain characteristics of a system. 

- **SI System**: Système International d'Unités, is the standard system of units over the world. 

- Types of systems 
    1. **CGS**: Centimeter, gram, second 
    2. **MKS**: Meter, kilogram, second
    3. **FPS**: Feet, pound, second 

Before 1875, different units systems were used over the world before **International Committee for Weights and Measures** declared SI system of units as default for the world. 

- Under **SI System of Units**: 
    1. Length: meter (m)
    2. Weight: kilogram (kg)
    3. Time: second (s)
    4. Thermodynamic temperature: Kelvin (K)
    5. Electric Current: Ampere (A)
    6. Amount of substance: Mole (mol)
    7. Luminous intensity: Candela (cd)

The above quantities are called **fundamental quantities**, since, they can be measured independently.  
When two or more units are used, they are callled derived quantities, eg: speed, velocity, area, volume. 

$\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{time}}$ and $\text{Velocity} = \frac{\overrightarrow{\text{Displacement}}}{time}$

$\therefore$ $\text{Distance} \neq \overrightarrow{\text{displacement}}$

----------

Acceleration can be defined as the rate of change of velocity per unit time. 

$\therefore \text{Acceleration} = \frac{\text{velocity}}{\text{time}} = \frac{L/T}{T} = \frac{L}{T^2}$
