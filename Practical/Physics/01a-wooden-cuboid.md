## Aim of the Experiment 
To find the volume of wooden cuboid using Vernier Caliper

## Apparatus Required 
Wooden Cuboid and Vernier Caliper 

## Theory 
To determine the volume of a cuboid, we have to determine the length, breadth and height of the cuboid using Vernier Caliper. 

**Measurement of the dimensions**: by holding the cuboid between the two jaws lengthwise, breadthwise and heightwise/thicknesswise. Let N be the main scale reading (MSR) just before the zero of the Vernier Caliper. 

If the nth division of the Vernier Caliper coincides with any divisions of the main scale, then, 

$\text{Vernier Scale Reading} (VSR) = n \times VC \text{ cm}$  
$\text{Thus, total length/breadth/height} = N + n \times VC$

$\text{Then, volume of the cuboid} = \text{length} \times \text{Breadth} \times \text{height}$

## Procedure 
1. The value of the smallest division of the main scale is determined.
2. The number of smallest divisions of the MS which coincide with a total number of Vernier divisions is found. After that, the VC of the instrument is found out. 
3. The movable jaw is made to just touch the fixed jaw and checked whether there is any IE. If it is so, the nature of the error is ascertained, and the value is calculated. To do so, the number of Vernier mark which exactly coincide with any mark of the MS is found. 
4. The jaws are opened, and the cuboid is held lengthwise, breadthwise and heightwise between the two jaws A and B. The jaw is adjusted such that it gently grips the cuboid without any undue pressure on it. 
5. The main scale reading ($N$) just before the zero of the vernier scale and the division ($n$) of the Vernier scale which exactly coincide with any division of the main scale is noted. 
6. Step 5 is repeated by shifting to a new place of the same side. 
7. Step 4-6 are repeated along other faces of the cuboid. 
8. The volume of the cuboid is calculated by using the formula cited above. 

## Observation 
1. **Readings** 
    1. Value of smallest division of MS = 0.1 cm 
    2. A number of smallest divisions of the MS which coincides with the total number of Vernier divisions = 9 
2. **Calculations of VC and IE** 
    - $10 VSD = 9 MSD$ 
    - $VC = 1/10 \times 0.1 cm = 0.01 cm$
    - $IE = 0 cm$
3. **Table for measuring average length, breadth and height of the shape**

4. **Calculation**: the volume of the cuboid is 
    - $V = \text{avg. length} \times \text{avg. breadth} \times \text{avg. height}$
5. **Result**: the volume of the cuboid is $$
6. **Precautions**
    1. Make sure to check for instrumental error before calculation. 
    2. Always consider parallax error while observing. 
    3. Do not change the cuboid during the experiment.
