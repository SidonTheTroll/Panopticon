# Parts of Speech
> 21/08/2025

- Sentence 
    - Group of words: naming part = subject 
    - Must have complete meaning: saying part = predicate 

$\therefore$ Sentence = $\underset{\text{single or group of words}}{\text{Subject}}$ = $\underset{\text{single word or group of words}}{\text{Predicate}}$

Therefore, Sentences can be made with only 2 words. Eg: birds fly, water flows, flowers bloom, fire burns, dogs bark. 

Exceptional single words can also be sentences, provided subject is understood. Eg: go, come, stand, yes.
